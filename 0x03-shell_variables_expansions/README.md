Expansions
In Bash scripting, expansions are used to manipulate and transform variables, commands, and other elements within the shell. They allow you to perform various operations such as command substitution, parameter expansion, arithmetic expansion, and more.

Variables
Variables in Bash are used to store and manipulate data within a script. They can hold different types of values, including strings, numbers, and arrays. Variable names are case-sensitive and can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.

The alias Command
The alias command in Bash is used to create and manage aliases, which are shortcuts for longer commands or command sequences. Aliases allow you to define custom commands that expand to a longer command when executed.

Technical Writing
Technical writing refers to the process of creating documentation that explains complex technical concepts, procedures, or products in a clear and concise manner. It involves writing user guides, manuals, tutorials, and other forms of documentation to help users understand and use a particular technology or product.
