It is commonly used to filter out specific lines of text based on a pattern. For example, you can use grep to filter out all lines containing a specific word in a text file.

sed: sed (stream editor) is a powerful tool for text manipulation. It can perform various operations on input text, such as search and replace, insert or delete lines, and more. It reads input line by line, performs the specified operation, and outputs the modified text. For example, you can use sed to replace all occurrences of a word with another word in a text file.

awk: awk is a versatile programming language designed for text processing. It reads input line by line and performs actions based on patterns and actions specified in the program. Awk is particularly useful for extracting and manipulating data in structured text files. For example, you can use awk to extract specific columns from a CSV file.

sort: sort is a command-line utility that sorts lines of text alphabetically, numerically, or in a custom order. It reads input and outputs the sorted lines. You can use sort to sort the lines of a text file based on a specific field or column.

cut: cut is a command-line utility that extracts specific columns or fields from lines of text. It reads input line by line, splits each line into fields based on a delimiter, and outputs the specified fields. For example, you can use cut to extract the first three columns from a tab-separated value (TSV) file.
